  abstract = {A discrete modeling approach is proposed to simulate woven-fabric reinforcement forming via explicit finite element analysis. The tensile behaviour of the yarns is modeled by truss, beam or seatbelt elements, and the shearing behaviour of the fabric is incorporated within shell or membrane elements. This method is easy to set up using the user-defined material subroutine capabilities of explicit finite element programs. In addition, the determination of the material parameters is straightforward from conventional tensile and shear-frame tests. The proposed approach has been implemented in the ABAQUS and LS-DYNA explicit finite element programs. Two types of fabric, a plain-weave and a twill-weave Twintex{\textregistered} (commingled polypropylene and glass fibres) were characterized and used to validate the modeling approach. For this validation, shear-frame and bias-extension tests have been modeled, and the finite element results are compared to experimental data. The determination of experimental shear angle contours was possible via Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The finite element results from ABAQUS and LS-DYNA are similar and agree well with the experimental data. As an example of the capabilities of the method, the deep drawing of a hemisphere is simulated using both finite elements programs.},

  abstract = {A simplified finite element model is developed and validated for the forming/draping of pre-impregnated woven composites, incorporating the effects of wrinkling and strain rate dependence. The model development builds upon previous work on simulation of fabric draping using a truss representation of the woven material. Tows are modelled by stiff elastic bar elements, and the non-linear rate dependent shear behaviour is incorporated in elastic-viscoplastic elements that follow an appropriate phenomenological constitutive model. Wrinkling due to tow buckling is simulated by allowing the deactivation of tow elements that undergo compressive deformation. The model convergence is tested and its validity is checked against experimental results from the forming of pre-impregnated woven carbon hemispheres. It is found that the model reproduces successfully experimental measurements of shear and wrinkling with a relative error of approximately 4\%, while solution times are kept below 60s on a conventional PC. These features allow potential iterative use of the model within a process optimisation scheme. The sensitivity of the process outcome to process parameters such as blank holder force and forming speed is investigated.},

The set of four bars that delineate a quadrilateral element---the unit cell of the micromechanical analysis---is further endowed with a torsion deformation mode. The equilibrium shape of the structure is obtained as the minimum of its total potential energy versus the set of kinematic translational and rotational variables, accounting for eventual kinematic constraints due to contact with a rigid surface. A linearized stability analysis is performed, and the potentiality of the model is illustrated by fabric draping simulations.},

Tow geometry parameters are measured with the help of microscopy and image processing techniques. 3D geometrical models have been developed from the tow geometry data and used these models for micro-mechanical modelling of textile composites. In the published literature, authors mainly used idealised weave geometry ignoring the tow geometry variations during processing. The present paper demonstrates the impact of tensile, shear and transverse compression forces applied on dry fabrics during processing in relation to tow geometry. Experimental data was compared with theoretical predictions for a variety of weave topologies. Textile composite laminate properties have been estimated using modified laminate theory; these calculations demonstrated the impact of tow geometry changes during processing.},

  abstract = {The ply to ply interlock fabric preform enables to manufacture, by R.T.M. process, thick composite parts that are resistant to delamination and cracking. Numerical simulation of interlock reinforcement forming allows to determine conditions for feasibility of the process and above all to know the position of fibres in the final composite part. For this forming simulation, specific hexahedral finite elements made of segment yarns are proposed. Position of each yarn segment within the element is taken into account. This avoids determination of a homogenized equivalent continuous law that would be very difficult considering the complexity of the weaving. Transverse properties of fabric are taken into account within a hypoelastic constitutive law. A set of 3D interlock fabric forming simulations shows the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a new class of composite reinforcements has gained considerable attention: 3D woven fabrics. Their advantages in terms of reducing preforming steps and their resistance to impact and delamination have been clearly proven. However, relationships between fabric structure and composite properties are still largely unknown. Numerical models on different length scales were developed that capture the mechanical behavior of fabrics and their composites. This paper reviews models for 3D woven fabrics in the dry state and discusses results that were achieved with parametric studies. Special attention is given to the determination of the initial configuration of the 3D woven fabric model. The multi-filament character of yarns is best depicted with meso-scale approaches that describe the sub-yarn behavior with realistic models. Developed models can be used for further investigations, e. g. the optimization of fabric structure and forming processes.},

  abstract = {Several stress-based failure criteria (von Mises, dilatational strain energy density, parabolic stress and Drucker-Prager) are implemented in a numerical model of a 3D woven composite to predict initiation of damage due to cooling after curing. It is assumed that the composite is completely cured at elevated temperature and the residual stresses arise due to difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of fibers and matrix. The stresses are found by finite element analysis on the mesoscale while the effective thermoelastic properties of fiber tows are determined by micromechanical modeling. The matrix is modeled as an isotropic material with temperature dependent elastic properties and thermal expansion coefficient. Comparison of numerical simulation results with the microcomputed tomography data obtained for a one-by-one orthogonally reinforced carbon/epoxy composite shows that the parabolic stress and the dilatational strain energy criteria provide the most accurate predictions of cure-induced damage. However, the accuracy of the parabolic failure criterion is dependent on the choice of the mechanical tests used to determine the values of its two material parameters.},
